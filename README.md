# 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
## var is function scoped. let and const are block scoped. we can redeclare and reassign var. we cann't redeclar let and const. we can reassign value to the let but const doesn't allow reassign.

# 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
## map() does transform of every single element of an array and return a new array but forEach doesn't return something. While,filter() checks each element with a condition and returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.

# 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
## arrow function is the short form of a function and it can be written in a variable. Example: const sum = (a,b)=> {console.log(a+b)}

# 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
## Destructuring assignment in ES6 helps to easily extract values from arrays or objects into variables.In objects, we can directly create variables from the keys.


# 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
## Template literals in ES6 are strings written with backticks (``). They allow us to embed variables and expressions directly inside a string using ${} syntax. They are more readable and support multi-line strings without using \n. In contrast, traditional string concatenation requires using + operator, which is less clear and harder to manage with multiple variables.
